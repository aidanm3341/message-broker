<Hero title="Message Broker">
  The Message Broker is a Typescript library which aims to provide asynchronous
  communication between typescript components. It leverages the RxJS library to
  facilitate a pub/sub pattern and accepts user-defined contracts to ensure type
  safety across messages.

    <Article title="Background">
    This project was written at Morgan Stanley to provide an internal messaging system for large scale UI systems.
    The project was later Open Sourced so others could benefit from it.

    <Article title="Use cases">
    Here is an example of a usecase in which the Message Broker could be useful.

    #### Notification system

    Let's say you have some document uploading functionality in your UI.
    The uploading may take up to a minute and you don't want the user to have to wait, so once the upload is complete you want to have a pop-up notification appear which tells the user that their upload was successful.

    The code for your pop-up notification can live anywhere in your codebase, and can "listen" for a "document_uploaded" message using the MessageBroker.
    Now all that needs to happen is for the document upload service to publish that message when the upload completes.

    **Note:** that with this model, our document uploading service doesn't even have to know about the existence of the notification service, so everything is nice and decoupled.

    #### Mediator Pattern

    More generically, the Message Broker essentially acts as a [Mediator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator) for your components.
    Any time you would apply the Mediator pattern, the Message Broker is the perfect solution to avoid you some boilerplate coding.

    <Article title="Alternatives">
    List of alternatives to the Message Broker.

    - [BullMQ](https://docs.bullmq.io)
        - Relies on Redis
    - [@node-ts/bus](https://bus.node-ts.com)

    Both of these alternatives lack the same level of type safety that the Message Broker provides.
